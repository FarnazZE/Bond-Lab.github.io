                                        <h2>Overview</h2>
									<p>Nervous systems are complex networks comprised of spatially distributed regions. These regions are linked to one another by structural and functional 
                                        connections that represent interregional white-matter fiber pathways and pairwise statistical relationships between regional activity, respectively. 
                                        We use computational tools from network science, dynamical systems theory and, machine learning to study the organization of these structural and functional 
                                        connection in human brain networks (obtained from diffusion weighted imaging, fMRI, or EEG) with the goal of understanding the underlying mechanisms for <em> cognition, development, and disease.</em> Some of our current research projects are:

												<h2> Structure-function relationships in brain networks</h2>
												<p>It is widely understood that functional connectivity (FC) reflects the outcome of an ongoing dynamical process and is constrained 
                                                    by the underlying structural connectivity (SC). However, the precise mapping of SC to FC is complex and poorly understood, 
                                                    especially at the level of individual brain regions. To address these challenges, we use a set of network measures that quantifies 
                                                    the interregional and whole-brain communication policies in the structural brain networks and examine their predictive capacities of FC. 
                                                    Specifically, we are interested to understand how does the physical layout of the brain shape the temporal changes of its function? How 
                                                    does this relationship vary across the cerebral cortex? How does structure-function relationship are affected by neurological and 
                                                    developmental disorders such as Alzheimer, dementia, and autism spectrum disorder? </p>

												<h2>  Dynamics of Functional Brain Networks</h2>
												<p>The functional coupling between brain regions changes over time, supporting
                                                    ongoing complex behaviors and cognitive processes. However, the underlying neural mechanisms
                                                    that enable efficient reconfiguration of these functional connectivity patterns remain unclear.
                                                    We address this challenge using newly proposed “edge-centric”
                                                    approach, which allows capturing the changes in the co-fluctuation patterns between brain
                                                    regions at a framewise time scale. We are specifically interested to look into questions such as how fast does
                                                    the brain switch between different dynamical regimes? How could we detect and model these
                                                    switches? And does this switching behavior depend on the state of patients with mental disorders?</p>

												<h2>  Getting Beyond Brain Networks</h2>
												<p>Studying brain networks provides invaluable insights into the underlying mechanisms of the human brain . 
                                                    On a higher level, we can also study interrelationship of the behavioral and cognitive outputs and their
                                                     impact in shaping the overall mental states of individuals. We are particularly interested to use the notion of
                                                      network science in combination with dynamic systems theory to represent these variables as networks and characterize
                                                       their temporal changes. Some of the specific questions we explore include: How does the intrinsic and extrinsic events
                                                        influence the brain networks? Does this influence depend on the severity and length of an event? And how can we control
                                                         and suppress these influences?</p>
